# CALiPPSO: A Linear Programming Algorithm for Jamming Hard Spheres


This is the accompanying code to the paper XXXX, by *Artiaco, DÃ­az, Parisi, and Ricci-Tersenghi*. There, we introduce and describe an iterative Linear Programming (ILP) algorithm to produce jammed packings of hard-spheres (HS) *in arbitrary* dimensions, $d$.
Essentially, our method consists on a **C**hain of **A**pproximate **Li**near **P**rogramming for **P**acking **S**pherical **O**bjects.
The code contained here is written in pure [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and makes extensive use of  the (wonderful) optimization and modelling package [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl). 

Please feel free to use/modify/improve this code as better suits you. We only ask you to give credit to our work.

If you already know how CALiPPSO works (or know the theory behind our paper), you can safely skip to [the usage section](#basic-usage) where we describe our code in some detail. Otherwise, [the introduction](#introduction-how-calippso-works-and-some-terminology) provides the essentials to understand our method.
