# Problem solving

## Possible issues 

1. Modify `sbound` if isostaticity gap is negative for several steps due to `abs(s_i)=sbound*R`
2. If isostaticity gap is too big (and positive), possibly there is small precision in the value of dual variables (*e.g.* when using Tulip). This could be solved by looking for dual variable larger than a given threshold value, but still needs to be implemented.
   1. This might be the case even when such gap is not too big. For instance, using GLPK in the LS tests, the initial iterations throw a gap of about +6 (due to very small forces)
3. A *negative* isostaticity can be caused by the maximal displacement (of *stable* particles) being equal to the bound on $|s_{i,\mu}^\star|$. If this happens, try using a larger value of `sbound`. 
   1. In reality, what happens is that there is an *active* dual variable related to such bound on the displacements and *not* to a contacts. Thus, the system is nonetheless isostatic, but a contact has not being properly counted, since it is not included in the lists of `constraints` in the main ILP loop.
4. The right convergence tolerance values, *i.e.* the right choice of `tol_Î“_convergence` and `tol_S_convergence` possibly depend on the solver
5. `Tulip.jl` give an isostatic config only when the status of the optimization is `ITERATION_LIMIT`, which also entails that forces are determined with very, very low accuracy. Notably, even though this happens, the force mismatch is very small.
