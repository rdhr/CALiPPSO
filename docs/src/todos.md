# Some ToDo's

- [ ] Add implementation for polydisperse packigns
- [ ] Try to implement model creation with `direct_model` instead of `Model` (to avoid copying the model).
  - Currently, when `direct` model is used it throws the error `The solver does not support an objective function of type MathOptInterface.SingleVariable.` when using HiGHS (and possibly with other solvers similar errors occur). 
- [X] Add section (or at least explanation) about rattlers
- [X] Remove `monitor_force_balance` from kwargs of main function
- [X] Clarify that `precompile_main_function` can be set to `false` to avoid pre-compiling
- [X] Add precompiling behaviour conditioned on whether `precompile_main_function` has been defined or not; use `@isdefined`.
- [X] Once the point above has been resolved, removed all the output whenever `precompile_main_function=false`. This means avoid creating the first packings that throw warnings due to the absence of force balance.
- [ ] Finish the documentation
- [ ] Check all links
- [ ] Add API of main functions (remember to add it to side bar and TOC)
- [ ] Add examples using [Literate.jl](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/v2/)
- [ ] Finish/correct *docstrings* in the scripts
- [ ] Change `iLP-for-jamming.jl` to `CALiPPSO.jl` or something like that. Remember to also change the name in the documentation and relevant scripts.
- [ ] Change "ILP" to "CALiPPSO", and "Steps" to "Iterations" in the printed output of `produce_jammed_configuration` and *in the rest of the files, __including scripts__*
- [ ] Add `verbose` argument to `MonoPacking` function called when the final packing is constructed.
- [ ] Add time of `fine_tune_forces!` to total time.
- [ ] Add array of `max_si_vs_t` to the output of `produce_jammed_configuration`
- [ ] Improve the `show` method for `MonoParticle` and `MonoPacking`
